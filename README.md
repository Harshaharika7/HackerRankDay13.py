# 📘 Day 13: Abstract Classes | HackerRank 30 Days of Code

This repository contains the Python solution for **Day 13** of the HackerRank 30 Days of Code challenge, which focuses on the concept of **Abstract Classes** in object-oriented programming.

## 🚀 Challenge Summary

You are given an abstract class `Book` and are required to create a subclass `MyBook`.

Your task is to implement the constructor and the abstract method `display()` in the `MyBook` class.

## 📝 Problem Statement

Complete the `MyBook` class by:

- Creating a constructor that takes `title`, `author`, and `price` as parameters.
  
- Implementing the `display()` method to print:
  
        Title: <title>
        
        Author: <author>
        
        Price: <price>

## ✅ Constraints

- `title` and `author` are non-empty strings
  
- `price` is a positive integer

## 🔢 Sample Input

    The Alchemist
    
    Paulo Coelho
    
    248

## ✅ Sample Output

    Title: The Alchemist
    
    Author: Paulo Coelho
    
    Price: 248

## 💡 Explanation

You are required to create a derived class `MyBook` that extends the abstract class `Book` and implements the `display()` method to print the required format.

## 🧠 Concepts Practiced

- Abstract Base Classes (`ABCMeta`)
  
- Method Overriding
  
- Constructor Initialization
  
- Inheritance in Python
  
- Output Formatting

## 🛠 How to Run

Option 1: With input file

Create a file named `input.txt` with the required input and run:

    python3 abstract_classes.py < input.txt

Option 2: Manual input

Just run:

    python3 abstract_classes.py
